    <h2><b><u><font color="blue">Regular Season</font></u></b></h2>
<p>With my final soccer season around the corner, I was anxious with high expectations. Our team had underperformed my previous three seasons at Druid Hills High School, but this year was it. We were bound for greatness as our starting lineup consisted entirely of dedicated seniors. All my years of soccer came down to this final season as I was not planning on playing in college. Before I knew it, we started the anticipated season against South Gwinnett High School. Unfortunantly, our first game did not go as planned. We lost in dramatic fashion 3-4 in a last minute goal. However, it served as a wake up call to all the players and coaches. No longer were we going to be unfocused in practice. It was all seriousness from there on out. We won the next five straight, but not without a few bumps along ther road. In a match against Dalton High School, our team chemistry began to fold. After a heart-breaking goal in the final minutes, our team began blaming one another for the loss. That type of behavior can be cancerious to team leading to its downfall, but we were able to work out our issues at practice and move forward. As one of the captains of the team, I felt responsible to repair the chemistry of the team. Finally, the playoffs had arrived and it was time to prove to the entire state that we were the best team in Georgia. Personally, I had a great regular season leading the team in assists.</p>
    <h2><b><u><font color="blue">Playoffs</font></u></b></h2>
<p>Following our impressive regular season, we had big expectations heading into the playoffs. Druid Hills Varsity soccer had never made it past the first round in school history. The prior two seasons in the playoffs, we lost in penalty kicks which was very disheartening. We pushed ourselves this season physically and mentally to get over the first round hump and move closer to the state championship. The highly anticipated first game was full of nerves. We were not going to be sent home this year in the first round. As expected, we won our first round matchup along with the following three rounds of the playoffs. We were headed to the school's first state championship game. Win or lose we had accomplished our goals as we overcame several obstacles throughout the season. My soccer carrer ended in a 3-4 loss in overtime in the state final, but I was proud to have been given the opportunity to make history and accomplish as much as we did with my fellow teammates. </p>
    <h2><b><u><font color="blue">Outcomes of the Season</font></u></b></h2>
<p>My final season of soccer was full of ups and downs, but proved to be the most memorable. Although we came up short, I regret nothing and I will charish the memories I share with my teammates. I learned what team bonding truely is as we came together with one common goal. I also learned how to overcome adversity. We never gave up even when the odds were stacked against us. I can apply the lessons I have learned to everyday life by challenging myself to never give up on my goals. This final season of soccer taught me that pushing myself will open new unseen opportunities which in turn has made me a better person.</p>
